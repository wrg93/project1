## Description
As a user seeking disaster preparedness I want my location to be identified or be entered 
So that I may able to see a history of natural disasters in my area 
And I am given a list of most relevant survival supplies I want to be able to enter variables such as infants and number of dependents
So that my list of necessities is adjusted correctly I want to be able to save a list of objects in local storage 
So that I may use said list to purchase objects online
